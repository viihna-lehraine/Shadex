## Upcoming Features

- Seperate page for color palette history
- Options for color palette export (from main page AND history)
- Getting rid of the annoying window alerts and instead auto-selecting the minimum number of color swatches
- Additional color schemes
- Choose the initially generated color space (allows for a larger color space; i.e., HSL has ~3.5 million possibile colors, while Hex has ~15 million)
- Copy button tooltip (will give you a visual alert that copy was successful)
- Double-clicking color values will let you highlight them, much like you would any other text
- UI overhaul and aesthetic updates
- Optimized mobile layout and functionality
- UI element explanation and tips that will show when hovering over them

  2. Increase / Decrease saturation for individual swatches
  3. Increase / Decrease lightness for individual swatches
  3. Block duplicate colors
  4. Block pure white and black

and finally

- Smarter algorithms for all the palettes. I acknowledge they are not perfect, or even great yet. I will strive to get these into a better state for less bizarre outputs :)


Farther in the future (around 1.0) I also plan to release this as a desktop app (Windows / MacOS / Linux compatible) and mobile app (Android and iOS). However, iOS development may have to come out later. I'll give more details when I start work on porting these versions.

## Known Issues

Please be aware that, in its current state, I have not done a full test session to track bugs. These are just the ones I've noticed so far. Feel free to [contact](#contact-me) me to point out any bugs I haven't listed here yet!

- Drag and Drop works for a short period of time before breaking
- Drag and Drop doesn't work at all on mobile
- Saturate and Desaturate buttons do absolutely nothing
- Mobile layout needs a full rework
- Gray/Black limiting and Light limiting are very primitive. Both need adjustment
- Gray/Black limiting and Light limiting will only work for HSL color space
- Diadic palette logic needs investigation. I'm not convinced it is working correctly
